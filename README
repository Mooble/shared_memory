Simple student database using shared memory.

A makefile is provided.
	Since "clean" is standard for removing files made by the makefile, the 
	step for building the "clean" program has been named cleanup, and a 
	PHONY rule has been added to get the clean step to remove files.

	Other than that step, all the others are straight forward.  Running
	"make load" for instance, will build the load program by itself.
	Running "make all" or just "make" will all 5 programs.

The load program expects an input file to be provided.  It will complain 
	and abort if you do not provide one when running it.

The clean program also expects a filename, to know where to save the 
	database.  It will default to "rnolan_database.dat" if you do not
	provide one, however.
